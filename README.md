Simple examples of what can be done with Docker and Kubernetes

To run this, you must have :
- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then, to create the Docker images : `docker-compose build`

Once finished, you will be able to execute : `docker-compose up`

You will have 3 servers running on ports 8090, 8091 and 8092

For the part on Kubernetes you will need a little more documentation,
here is a beginning of the track for that :
